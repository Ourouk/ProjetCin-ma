# Multi-Language Threading, Networking, and Encryption Demonstration
Welcome to the Multi-Language Threading, Networking, and Encryption Demonstration repository! This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of how threading, network communication, and encryption can be effectively implemented in two prominent programming languages: C and Java.
## C Part: Movie Inventory and Availability Management
### C Server
In the C component of the project, we focus on efficiently managing the cinema's movie inventory. This involves storing information about available movies and tracking the number of available seats for each screening.
### C Client
The client is meant to permit adding Movies and setting available seats.

## Java Part: Secure Communication with Web Browsers and C server
The Java Server component serves as the bridge between the C-based backend and the end-users' web browsers. It boasts two pivotal functionalities: 

### Client for C server
The Java Server is equipped with a client interface that seamlessly communicates with the C server. This ensures real-time synchronization of movie listings and seat availability, providing users with up-to-date information.

### Https Web server
Meant to make information information available for classical users.

### Repo Structure
To facilitate easy navigation and utilization of the project, we've structured the repository as follows:

    /c_server: Contains the C-based cinema management software.
    /java_server: Houses the Java Server with client-server communication capabilities and HTTPS support.
